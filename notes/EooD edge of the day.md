Key Paper:

+ Unsupervised Learning of Visual Representations by Solving Jigsaw Puzzles
  + Introduce self-supervised learning to solve jigsaw puzzle. General-prior:
  + transfer the learned model (pretext task in jigsaw puzzle) to finetune in object classficiation and detection using context-free network (CFN);
+ Unsupervised Learning of Visual Representations using Videos
  + Semantically-labelled images are not necessary to learn feature representation;
  + two patches connected by a track should have similar visual representation in deep feature space since they probably belong to the same object and thus could be used to learn feature representation in an unsupervised manner;
  + compare to infant picking up stuff: infants develop visual tracking ability at first stage then learn
